The Contractor had filed a claim for interim EOT and for additional costs\non account of delay events till 30.06.2021 by way of a letter to the\nEngineer dated 11.03.2022. Thereafter, on 25.08.2022, the Engineer had\nprovided its assessment on the said claims (both for interim EOT and for\nadditional costs) for delay events till 30.06.2021, and sought the\nContractor's unconditional consent to the erroneous assessments.\n3. The Contractor informed the Engineer on 16.01.2023 that it disagrees\nwith the Engineer\n's erroneous assessment of both the claims for interim\nEOT and for additional costs and requested the Engineer to provide its\ndetermination on the same in terms of the Contract. The Contractor has\nprovided detailed reasons as to why the Engineer\n's assessment of\nContractor's interim EOT claims, and rejection of cost claims is incorrect\nfor being in teeth of the contractual provisions and the applicable laws.\nThe Engineer has not made any determination on the same till date, which\nis also contrary to the requirement under the Contract, which specifically\nprovides that such determination shall not he unreasonably withheld or\ndelayed.\n4. Till date, the Engineer, in complete derogation of the agreed terms and\nconditions of the Contract, has not provided any determination under\nClause 20.1 read with Clause 3.5 of GCC on the claims of the Contractor\non account of delay events till 30.06.2021.\n5. In terms of Clause 20.1 of the GCC, once a claim for Extension of Time for\ncompletion and/ or any additional payments is notified by the Contractor\nto the Engineer, the Engineer is under an obligation to respond within 42\ndays with either approval, or disapproval (with detailed comments). The\nsaid period of 42 days may only be extended if proposed by the Engineer\nto that effect and if such proposal is approved by the Engineer.\n6. Further, in each such instances where the Contractor raises a claim for\nEOT and/or additional payments, the Engineer is required, under Clause\n20.1 read with Clause 3.5 of the GCC, to consult each party i.e., the\nEmployer and the Contractor, \nttheN »\n.ch an agreement, or (failing\n3 | Page\nr\nn\n5\n"

Moreover, in terms of Clause 1.3 of the GCC, such\n\"determination\" shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n7. Therefore, under the Contract, the Engineer cannot decline or\nunreasonably withhold its determination on the Contractor\n's claims. It is\nsubmitted that merely because the Contractor may have acceded to such\na request in the past, the same neither amounts to any waiver of its\ncontractual rights, nor does it absolve the Engineer of its obligations to\nmake determinations in a timely manner.\n8. In this case, there exists a very significant dispute on several key issues\nregarding the manner and methodology of determination of interim EOT\nand additional payments due on account of delay not attributable to the\nContractor. The Contractor's position is that resolution of the said dispute\nis critical as it has a direct bearing on the completion of the work under\nthe Contract, which is already severely delayed due to delays beyond the\ncontrol of and not attributable to the Contractor. The Contractor has\nalready incurred significant additional costs on account of such delays,\nwhich are still continuing to affect the work under the Contract. The\nContractor's ability to plan the remaining work is also severely affected on\naccount of the above dispute.\n9. Hence, it is critical that the claims made by the Contractor by way of the\npresent Request for Decision is decided in terms of Clause 20.4 of the\nGeneral Conditions.\nII.

In other words, the mere\noccurrence of a delay event attributable to the counter party will not\nipso facto constitute concurrent delay if that event does not impact the\ncritical path to completion.\n(d) The Engineer failed to analyse delays using the critical path/longest\npath method and thereby failed to establish whether the Contractor's\ndelay, if any, fall on the critical path or caused critical delay to the\nconstruction schedule as per the CCP.

The Costs incurred in respect of disruption to the Works and loss of productivity in performing the Works are separate and distinct from the  prolongation  costs discussed in  the preceding paragraphs. The Contractor submits that it is entitled to claim disruption costs pursuant to Clause 20.1 of GCC read with Clause 2.1, Clause 13.1 and Clause 13.7 of GCC / PC. 32.The Contractor has undertaken the“measured mile analysis\" to quantify its “Disruption Measured Mile costs\". In the measured mile analysis, the Contractor has compared tasks in impacted and non-impacted periods (or less impacted periods) of the project to estimate the productivity loss caused by the impact of a known series of events (in this case, the Disruptive Events). It is based on an extrapolation of actual working (labour and equipment) hours spent. The Contractor's Disruption Measured Mile costs are divided as per the following construction events: (a) Foundations and Masts; (b) Brackets; (c) OHE Wiring; and (d) Droppering 33.The quantification of the Contractor's Disruption Measured Mile costs is summarised in thebelow table:",

(b) The Engineer exhibited an erroneous and flawed understanding of the concept of ‘concurrent delay’ in railway construction and wrongly applied this flawed understanding to the Contractor's claims. Approvals, certificates, consents and determinations shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. When a certificate is issued to a Party, the certifier shall send a copy to the other Party.

In other words, the mere occurrence of a delay event attributable to the counter party will not ipso facto constitute concurrent delay if that event does not impact the criticalpath tocompletion (d) The Engineer failed to analyse delays using the critical path/longest path method and thereby failed to establish whether the Contractor's delay,if any,fall on the critical path or caused critical delay to the construction schedule as per the CCP. Whereas, the Contractor had duly identified the as-built critical path and analysed the effective cause of delay to the critical path while submitting its claim for delay events up to 30.06.2021.Therefore, the Engineer has incorrectly rejected the Prolongation Cost Claim and Change of Sequence/Disruption Cost Claim of the Contractor (Exhibit-9.03). (e) Further, it is well settled under the applicable principles of Indian law that where, due to the failure to perform contractual obligations on the part of one party, loss is caused to the other party, that other party is entitled toclaim damagestocompensatefor theadditionalcosts and losses incurred. These would include the extra costs in performance of the work including additional expenditure on extra cost of labour, staff, overhead expenses, plant and machinery, opportunity being lost to movetosomeotherprojectsinhand andearnrevenue,additional cost of materials which may not be compensated by the Contract mechanism, etc. Further, claims for escalation on account of increase in prices beyond the original contract period apart from claims for idling are maintainable.
